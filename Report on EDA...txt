Introduction: I did an exploratory data analysis (EDA) Project of the Forbes Billionaires dataset from 2022 with python in colab in this
              report focusing on wealth distribution, age demographics, and industry representation among the world’s   
              richest individuals.
EDA:
     EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task and 
     provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if 
     the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate.

Dataset: The dataset includes key attributes such as name, net worth, age, industry, and country. 

   Data Summary:
      •	First 5 Rows  : Displayed the names, ages, net worth, and industries of the top individuals.
      •	Last 5 Rows   : Provided insights into less prominent billionaires.
      •	Missing Values: Identified no significant missing or duplicate data.
      •	Shape         : The dataset consists of X rows and Y columns (replace with actual numbers).
      •	Additional    : I also added some additional counts of different columns.
                    Visualizations
     1.	Age Distribution: I visualized the concentration of billionaires in specific age groups.
     2.	Net worth Frequency: This plot illustrated how many billionaires fall into different net worth ranges.
     3.	Industry vs. Frequency: I highlighted the industries with the most billionaires.
     4.	Net Worth by Age and Industry: This visualization showed how net worth varies with age and industry.
     5.	Top 10 Richest Individuals: I displayed the wealth of the ten richest people.
     6.	Richest People from India: This identified the wealthiest individuals in India.
     7.	Young Billionaires: I listed billionaires under 50 years old.
     8.	Industry Analysis: This showed which industries have the most billionaires.

Conclusion: This EDA provides a comprehensive view of the wealth dynamics among billionaires, highlighting
            the ultimate factors such as age, industry, and geographic distribution that influence wealth.  
            Further research could explore trends over time or the impact of global economic shifts on billionaire status.
